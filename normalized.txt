there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do

she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not

his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it

i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon

he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly

sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then

she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it

the cab arrived late

there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny

there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon

this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
things arent going well at all with mom today

there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
i havent bailed on writing

i will start writing consistently again
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button

i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing

according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains

you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do

to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to

what have you noticed today
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was

the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together

it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
she wanted rainbow hair

spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal

dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself

to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling

it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach

it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project

it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time

it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle

his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it

it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before

he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains

she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden

she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment

colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work

i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
what is the best way to get what you want she asked

how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
he ordered his regular breakfast

it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
there are only three ways to make this work

i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important

she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray

i sure hope that things get better soon
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry

sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was

she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to

what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it

the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo

since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden

every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized

explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling

there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up

i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
i havent bailed on writing

there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance

where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem

it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance

what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it

you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage

he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation

the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years

it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
there was no time

it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears

pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath

what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body

i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it

i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up

what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end

she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
he had three simple rules by which he lived

what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember

and the next day would be christmas
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains
here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions
”
he ordered his regular breakfast

this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence

yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind

you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her

im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention

i am grateful for the distraction
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence

it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint

she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed

youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun

yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence

she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon

dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage

he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears

the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more

the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans

it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate

there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention

i am grateful for the distraction

he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years

you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him

it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created

he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time

why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning

she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so

of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then

there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied

im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem

i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it

all things in moderation

the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it

he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember

pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life

if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway

the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep

it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare

he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years

the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important

debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air

its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table

indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top

what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price

he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it

he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life

it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep

he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon

there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat

all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps

what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land

debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time

dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything

the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air

hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask

the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it

a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents

this is much more than i ever signed up to do
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like

the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared

what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction

spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it

three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last

they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all

it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created

she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same

she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore

dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her

it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body

thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep

he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction

his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks

she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself

it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to

im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains
here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions
”
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call

heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him

he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate

the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want

you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger

im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt

stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same

it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it

he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself

what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare

that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through

your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next

it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie

yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo

pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes

dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo

the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing

she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
she was in a hurry

stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched

marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone

she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement

or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
the young man wanted a role model

she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want

balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to

he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do

he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up

colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun

marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again

indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains

he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life

even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound

i dont know how i know but i just do
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging

do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes

it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning

they had been utilized on purpose

that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola

he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust

then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
the headphones were on

his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did

itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
he took a sip of the drink
he wasnt sure whether he liked it or not but at this moment it didnt matter
she had made it especially for him so he would have forced it down even if he had absolutely hated it
thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt

all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true

josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way

turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains
here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions
”
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning

it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land

thats simply the way things worked
she made him a newfangled drink each day and he took a sip of it and smiled saying it was excellent
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time

i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
she considered the birds to be her friends
shed put out food for them each morning and then shed watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day
she wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her
would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not

it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last

all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
she reached her goal exhausted
even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought shed feel upon reaching it wasnt there
something wasnt right
was this the only feeling shed have for over five years of hard work
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trapped hes been planning for years
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop

there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
since they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see they must have been formed quite recently that is geologically speaking
what can explain these striations and their common orientation did you ever hear about the great ice age or the pleistocene epoch less than one million years ago in fact some 12000 years ago an ice sheet many thousands of feet thick rode over burke mountain in a southeastward direction
the many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet tended to scratch the rocks over which they rode
the scratches or striations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached boulders
the ice sheet also plucked and rounded burke mountain into the shape it possesses today
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
the spot was perfect for camouflage
at least thats what she thought when she picked the spot
she couldnt imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings
so there she sat confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger
unfortunately she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
i recollect that my first exploit in squirrelshooting was in a grove of tall walnuttrees that shades one side of the valley
i had wandered into it at noontime when all nature is peculiarly quiet and was startled by the roar of my own gun as it broke the sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
there once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily bread
the old man used to go to fix fences and do other odd jobs for the farmers around and while he was gone the old woman his wife did the work of the house and worked in their own little plot of land
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
she never liked cleaning the sink
it was beyond her comprehension how it got so dirty so quickly
it seemed that she was forced to clean it every other day
even when she was extra careful to keep things clean and orderly it still ended up looking like a mess in a couple of days
what she didnt know was there was a tiny creature living in it that didnt like things neat
sometimes its simply better to ignore the haters
thats the lesson that toms dad had been trying to teach him but tom still couldnt let it go
he latched onto them and their hate and couldnt let it go but he also realized that this wasnt healthy
thats when he came up with his devious plan
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
she tried to explain that love wasnt like pie
there wasnt a set number of slices to be given out
there wasnt less to be given to one person if you wanted to give more to another
that after a set amount was given out it would all disappear
she tried to explain this but it fell on deaf ears
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
it was a scrape that he hardly noticed
sure there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures
there was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream
he felt perfectly normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
dave wasnt exactly sure how he had ended up in this predicament
he ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and it still didnt make sense
he wanted to spend some time to try and make sense of it all but he had higher priorities at the moment
the first was how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow falling all around and no way for him to get down
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
it was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week
she had her eyes on him for months and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen but hed finally taken the hint and asked her out
after all the time and effort shed invested into it she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful
it goes without saying that things didnt work out quite as she expected
the alarm went off and jake rose awake
rising early had become a daily ritual one that he could not fully explain
from the outside it was a wonder that he was able to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely no plans to be productive during the entire day
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down

a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
it had become a far too common an event in her life
she has specifically placed the key to the box in a special place so that she wouldnt lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed
now that she needed to open the box she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
if you can imagine a furry humanoid seven feet tall with the face of an intelligent gorilla and the braincase of a man youll have a rough idea of what they looked like  except for their teeth
the canines would have fitted better in the face of a tiger and showed at the corners of their wide thinlipped mouths giving them an expression of ferocity
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
she wanted rainbow hair
thats what she told the hairdresser
it should be deep rainbow colors too
she wasnt interested in pastel rainbow hair
she wanted it deep and vibrant so there was no doubt that she had done this on purpose
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
it was a scrape that he hardly noticed
sure there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures
there was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream
he felt perfectly normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
he was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind that showed the wonder of our ingenuity
there are huge heads on easter island
there are the egyptian pyramids
there’s stonehenge
but he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply didnt make any sense and he wondered how he was ever going to be able to explain it
she had been an angel for coming up on 10 years and in all that time nobody had told her this was possible
the fact that it could ever happen never even entered her mind
yet there she stood with the undeniable evidence sitting on the ground before her
angels could lose their wings
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
there was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe
all one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty
yet bob didnt see another option
he may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through but time was something he didnt have
a choice needed to be made and it needed to be made quickly
he knew what he was supposed to do
that had been apparent from the beginning
that was what made the choice so difficult
what he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same
this would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences but he wasnt
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
many people say that life isnt like a bed of roses
i beg to differ
i think that life is quite like a bed of roses
just like life a bed of roses looks pretty on the outside but when youre in it you find that it is nothing but thorns and pain
i myself have been pricked quite badly
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
all he could think about was how it would all end
there was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation but the basics were there for anyone to see
no matter how much he tried to see the positive it wasnt anywhere to be seen
the end was coming and it wasnt going to be pretty
the spot was perfect for camouflage
at least thats what she thought when she picked the spot
she couldnt imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings
so there she sat confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger
unfortunately she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
there was little doubt that the bridge was unsafe
all one had to do was look at it to know that with certainty
yet bob didnt see another option
he may have been able to work one out if he had a bit of time to think things through but time was something he didnt have
a choice needed to be made and it needed to be made quickly
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips

i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains
here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions
”
what were they eating it didnt taste like anything she had ever eaten before and although she was famished she didnt dare ask
she knew the answer would be one she didnt want to hear
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
she didnt like the food
she never did
she made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming
but this time was different
instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
debbie put her hand into the hole sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach
she wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something but all she felt was air
she shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole
her fingers still touched nothing but air
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road

all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
begin today thats all the note said
there was no indication from where it came or who may have written it
had it been meant for someone else meghan looked around the room but nobody made eye contact back
for a brief moment she thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she crumpled it up and threw it away
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
it was their first date and she had been looking forward to it the entire week
she had her eyes on him for months and it had taken a convoluted scheme with several friends to make it happen but hed finally taken the hint and asked her out
after all the time and effort shed invested into it she never thought that it would be anything but wonderful
it goes without saying that things didnt work out quite as she expected
the alarm went off and jake rose awake
rising early had become a daily ritual one that he could not fully explain
from the outside it was a wonder that he was able to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely no plans to be productive during the entire day
waiting and watching
it was all she had done for the past weeks
when you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink that’s about all you can do anyway
she watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut
she couldn’t reach it if she wanted too with that hole in the floor
she thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down
it had been her dream for years but dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true
there had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project
as she woke she realized she was once again at a crossroads
would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream dana rose and took her first step
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well

i myself have been pricked quite badly
sometimes its the first moment of the day that catches you off guard
thats what wendy was thinking
she opened her window to see fire engines screeching down the street
while this wasnt something completely unheard of it also wasnt normal
it was a sure sign of what was going to happen that day
she could feel it in her bones and it wasnt the way she wanted the day to begin
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill only a few miles from her house
the car had been hastily packed and marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets
dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldnt leave behind
he scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed
he continued to wait for marta to appear with the pets but she still was nowhere to be seen
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
sometimes thats just the way it has to be
sure there were probably other options but he didnt let them enter his mind
it was done and that was that
it was just the way it had to be
where do they get a random paragraph he wondered as he clicked the generate button
do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere at that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same
he sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction
she sat staring ahead never noticing that she was being watched
both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe they had been happy together
there was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming
in his youth he sought adventure and the unknown but that had been years ago
he wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless
that curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone
colors bounced around in her head
they mixed and threaded themselves together
even colors that had no business being together
they were all one yet distinctly separate at the same time
how was she going to explain this to the others
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
the day had begun on a bright note
the sun finally peeked through the rain for the first time in a week and the birds were sinfging in its warmth
there was no way to anticipate what was about to happen
it was a worstcase scenario and there was no way out of it
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles
and now i want a cookie
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
there was something beautiful in his hate
it wasnt the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance
it was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate he didnt understand where it came from
it was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon
what have you noticed today i noticed that if you outline the eyes nose and mouth on your face with your finger you make an i which makes perfect sense but is something i never noticed before
what have you noticed today
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
she nervously peered over the edge
she understood in her mind that the view was supposed to be beautiful but all she felt was fear
there had always been something about heights that disturbed her and now she could feel the full force of this unease
she reluctantly crept a little closer with the encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build
she couldnt help but feel that something horrible was about to happen
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
shes asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore
the answers were always the same
well not exactly the same but the same in a general sense
a more accurate description was the answers never surprised her
so she asked for the 10000th time whats your favorite animal but this time was different
when she heard the young boys answer she wondered if she had heard him correctly
there were little things that she simply could not stand
the sound of someone tapping their nails on the table
a person chewing with their mouth open
another human imposing themselves into her space
she couldnt stand any of these things but none of them compared to the number one thing she couldnt stand which topped all of them combined
the rain and wind abruptly stopped but the sky still had the gray swirls of storms in the distance
dave knew this feeling all too well
the calm before the storm
he only had a limited amount of time before all hell broke loose but he stopped to admire the calmness
maybe it would be different this time he thought with the knowledge deep within that it wouldnt
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
it was a scrape that he hardly noticed
sure there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures
there was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream
he felt perfectly normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him
i recently discovered i could make fudge with just chocolate chips sweetened condensed milk vanilla extract and a thick pot on slow heat
i tried it with dark chocolate chunks and i tried it with semisweet chocolate chips
its better with both kinds
it comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate
the best addins are crushed almonds and marshmallows  what you get from that is rocky road
it takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it
all things in moderation friends
all things in moderation
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
there wasnt a bird in the sky but that was not what caught her attention
it was the clouds
the deep green that isnt the color of clouds but came with these
she knew what was coming and she hoped she was prepared
she looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through
you need to learn to think for yourself she wanted to tell him
your friends are holding you back and bringing you down
 but she didnt because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery he would never give them up
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
he walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible
bounding down the steps he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic
there was nobody there but a pair of old wornout shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down
had he past them without seeing them it didnt seem possible
he was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trap hed been planning for years
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
she didnt like the food
she never did
she made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming
but this time was different
instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
he sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time
it wasnt
had it been a hundred it quite possibly could have been
two hundred probably not
his mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time
many people say that life isnt like a bed of roses
i beg to differ
i think that life is quite like a bed of roses
just like life a bed of roses looks pretty on the outside but when youre in it you find that it is nothing but thorns and pain
i myself have been pricked quite badly
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
she had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about a person by their ears
the way they stuck out and the size of the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the person
of course she couldnt scientifically prove any of this but that didnt matter to her
before anything else she would size up the ears of the person she was talking to
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
waiting and watching
it was all she had done for the past weeks
when you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink that’s about all you can do anyway
she watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut
she couldn’t reach it if she wanted too with that hole in the floor
she thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down
dave found joy in the daily routine of life
he awoke at the same time ate the same breakfast and drove the same commute
he worked at a job that never seemed to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night
it was who he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change
she didnt like the food
she never did
she made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming
but this time was different
instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word
they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
im going to hire professional help tomorrow
i cant handle this anymore
she fell over the coffee table and now there is blood in her catheter
this is much more than i ever signed up to do
they rushed out the door grabbing anything and everything they could think of they might need
there was no time to doublecheck to make sure they werent leaving something important behind
everything was thrown into the car and they sped off
thirty minutes later they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important thing of all
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
greg understood that this situation would make michael terribly uncomfortable
michael simply had no idea what was about to come and even though greg could prevent it from happening he opted to let it happen
it was quite ironic really
it was something greg had said he would never wish upon anyone a million times yet here he was knowingly letting it happen to one of his best friends
he rationalized that it would ultimately make michael a better person and that no matter how uncomfortable everyone should experience racism at least once in their lifetime
you know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes i just got that feeling when talking with her
you know i dont believe in sixth senses but there is something not right with her
i dont know how i know but i just do
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
the shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember
in fact it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared
it had seemed theyd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place
why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again but while they all thought it nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it
so the shoes remained on the steps out of place in one sense but perfectly normal in another
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon

the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
waiting and watching
it was all she had done for the past weeks
when you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink that’s about all you can do anyway
she watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut
she couldn’t reach it if she wanted too with that hole in the floor
she thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down
do you really listen when you are talking with someone i have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way
she actually takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that words take on a whole new meaning
it was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him life
while everyone around him was in tears and upset he actually felt more at ease
the doctor said it would be less than a year
that gave him a year to live something hed failed to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
as she sat watching the world go by something caught her eye
it wasnt so much its color or shape but the way it was moving
she squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going but it didnt help
as she continued to stare into the distance she didnt understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body
she felt like she should get up and run
if only she could make out what it was
at that moment she comprehended what it was and where it was heading and she knew her life would never be the same
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
the alarm went off and jake rose awake
rising early had become a daily ritual one that he could not fully explain
from the outside it was a wonder that he was able to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely no plans to be productive during the entire day
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
ive rented a car in las vegas and have reserved a hotel in twentynine palms which is just north of joshua tree
well drive from las vegas through mojave national preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down
then spend all day on monday at joshua tree
we can decide the next morning if we want to do more in joshua tree or mojave before we head back
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
are you getting my texts she texted to him
he glanced at it and chuckled under his breath
of course he was getting them but if he wasnt getting them how would he ever be able to answer he put the phone down and continued on his project
he was ignoring her texts and he planned to continue to do so
there are only three ways to make this work
the first is to let me take care of everything
the second is for you to take care of everything
the third is to split everything 50  50
i think the last option is the most preferable but im certain itll also mean the end of our marriage
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
the spot was perfect for camouflage
at least thats what she thought when she picked the spot
she couldnt imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings
so there she sat confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger
unfortunately she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
the trees therefore must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious
at that they probably didnt have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land
and if that were true there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
hopes and dreams were dashed that day
it should have been expected but it still came as a shock
the warning signs had been ignored in favor of the possibility however remote that it could actually happen
that possibility had grown from hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny
that was until it wasnt and the hopes and dreams came crashing down
according to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the multnomah chapter of the daughters of the american revolution on may 12 1939 “college hall is the oldest building in continuous use for educational purposes west of the rocky mountains
here were educated men and women who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned professions
”
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
she patiently waited for his number to be called
she had no desire to be there but her mom had insisted that she go
shes resisted at first but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go
mom tended to be that way
she would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted
so here she sat patiently waiting for her number to be called
the lone lamp post of the onestreet town flickered not quite dead but definitely on its way out
suitcase by her side she paid no heed to the light the street or the town
a car was coming down the street and with her arm outstretched and thumb in the air she had a plan
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
josh had spent year and year accumulating the information
he knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field josh would be the one to call
the problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it
years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
the young man wanted a role model
he looked long and hard in his youth but that role model never materialized
his only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didnt want to be like
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
it was just a burger
why couldnt she understand that she knew hed completely changed his life around her eating habits so why couldnt she give him a break this one time she wasnt even supposed to have found out
yes he had promised her and yes he had broken that promise but still in his mind all it had been was just a burger
it was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed
you want to look but you dont at the same time
youre frozen with fear and unable to act
thats where she found herself and she didnt know what to do next
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
one dollar and eightyseven cents
that was all
and sixty cents of it was in pennies
pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied
one dollar and eightyseven cents
and the next day would be christmas
she had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last
it was something that she carried within her in everything she did but then he showed up and disrupted everything
he told her that she had it wrong
the first step wasnt the most important
the last step wasnt the most important
it was the next step that was the most important
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
she had been an angel for coming up on 10 years and in all that time nobody had told her this was possible
the fact that it could ever happen never even entered her mind
yet there she stood with the undeniable evidence sitting on the ground before her
angels could lose their wings
it was a rats nest
not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
this is important to remember
love isnt like pie
you dont need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones
no matter how much love you give you can always give more
it doesnt run out so dont try to hold back giving it as if it may one day run out
give it freely and as much as you want
it wasnt quite yet time to panic
there was still time to salvage the situation
at least that is what she was telling himself
the reality was that it was time to panic and there wasnt time to salvage the situation but he continued to delude himself into believing there was
turning away from the ledge he started slowly down the mountain deciding that he would that very night satisfy his curiosity about the manhouse
in the meantime he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge and explore among the foothills a bit before his naptime which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky
at that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside so all of the animals with one accord had decided it should be the hour for their midday sleep
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
there was something special about this little creature
donna couldnt quite pinpoint what it was but she knew with all her heart that it was true
it wasnt a matter of if she was going to try and save it but a matter of how she was going to save it
she went back to the car to get a blanket and when she returned the creature was gone
balloons are pretty and come in different colors different shapes different sizes and they can even adjust sizes as needed
but dont make them too big or they might just pop and then byebye balloon
itll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind
they can serve a variety of purposes from decorating to water balloon wars
you just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them
it was a concerning development that he couldnt get out of his mind
hed had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them but he couldnt understand how it had all stopped
there was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time and he had no idea that it would be the last
the box sat on the desk next to the computer
it had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier
she didnt who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been
as she began to unwrap it she had no idea that opening it would completely change her life
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
barbara had been waiting at the table for twenty minutes
it had been twenty long and excruciating minutes
david had promised that he would be on time today
he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
the wave crashed and hit the sandcastle headon
the sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded half the sandcastle was gone
the next wave hit not quite as strong but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away
the third wave a big one crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it
when it receded there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
stranded
yes she was now the first person ever to land on venus but that was of little consequence
her name would be read by millions in school as the first to land here but that celebrity would never actually be seen by her
she looked at the control panel and knew there was nothing that would ever get it back into working order
she was the first and it was not clear this would also be her last
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
it was so great to hear from you today and it was such weird timing he said
this is going to sound funny and a little strange but you were in a dream i had just a couple of days ago
id love to get together and tell you about it if youre up for a cup of coffee he continued laying the trap hed been planning for years
her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair
they were thick and almost horizontal emphasizing the depth of her eyes
she was rather handsome than beautiful
her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features
her manner was engaging
the computer wouldnt start
she banged on the side and tried again
nothing
she lifted it up and dropped it to the table
still nothing
she banged her closed fist against the top
it was at this moment she saw the irony of trying to fix the machine with violence
his parents continued to question him
he didnt know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth
he explained again and again and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination
there was no way that grandpa who had been dead for five years could have told him where the treasure had been hidden
of course it didnt help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how hed found it
i havent bailed on writing
look im generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track
i am making an effort
i will start writing consistently again
he had three simple rules by which he lived
the first was to never eat blue food
there was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue
people often asked about blueberries but everyone knows those are actually purple
he understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by but it had served him well thus far in the 50 years of his life
many people say that life isnt like a bed of roses
i beg to differ
i think that life is quite like a bed of roses
just like life a bed of roses looks pretty on the outside but when youre in it you find that it is nothing but thorns and pain
i myself have been pricked quite badly
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
the words hadnt flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks
he never imagined hed find himself with writers block but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him
that blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind
he didnt understand why he couldnt even type a single word just one to begin the process and build from there
and yet he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank
the amber droplet hung from the branch reaching fullness and ready to drop
it waited
while many of the other droplets were satisfied to form as big as they could and release this droplet had other plans
it wanted to be part of history
it wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history
so it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future
do you think youre living an ordinary life you are so mistaken its difficult to even explain
the mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary
the odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery but here you are
are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass
he walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible
bounding down the steps he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic
there was nobody there but a pair of old wornout shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down
had he past them without seeing them it didnt seem possible
he was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body
he looked at the sand
picking up a handful he wondered how many grains were in his hand
hundreds of thousands not enough the said under his breath
i need more
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
she was in a hurry
not the standard hurry when youre in a rush to get someplace but a frantic hurry
the type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death
she raced down the road ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars
she was only a few minutes away when traffic came to a dead standstill on the road ahead
things arent going well at all with mom today
she is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time
i sure hope that things get better soon
its not his fault
i know youre going to want to but you cant blame him
he really has no idea how it happened
i kept trying to come up with excuses i could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened but the more i tried the more i could see none of them would work
he was going to get her wrath and there was nothing i could say to prevent it
its always good to bring a slower friend with you on a hike
if you happen to come across bears the whole group doesnt have to worry
only the slowest in the group do
that was the lesson they were about to learn that day
shes asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore
the answers were always the same
well not exactly the same but the same in a general sense
a more accurate description was the answers never surprised her
so she asked for the 10000th time whats your favorite animal but this time was different
when she heard the young boys answer she wondered if she had heard him correctly
he wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends
it would be a risky move
yes the truth would make things a lot easier if they all stayed on the same page but the truth might fracture the group leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the truth
it was time to decide which way to go
it went through such rapid contortions that the little bear was forced to change his hold on it so many times he became confused in the darkness and could not for the life of him tell whether he held the sheep right side up or upside down
but that point was decided for him a moment later by the animal itself who with a sudden twist jabbed its horns so hard into his lowest ribs that he gave a grunt of anger and disgust
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field

he never was but he had promised this one time
she had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the last week until shed believed his promise
now she was paying the price
indescribable oppression which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness filled her whole being with a vague anguish
it was like a shadow like a mist passing across her souls summer day
it was strange and unfamiliar it was a mood
she did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband lamenting at fate which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken
she was just having a good cry all to herself
the mosquitoes made merry over her biting her firm round arms and nipping at her bare insteps
she wondered if the note had reached him
she scolded herself for not handing it to him in person
she trusted her friend but so much could happen
she waited impatiently for word
cake or pie i can tell a lot about you by which one you pick
it may seem silly but cake people and pie people are really different
i know which one i hope you are but thats not for me to decide
so what is it cake or pie
im meant to be writing at this moment
what i mean is im meant to be writing something else at this moment
the document im meant to be writing is of course open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my attention
yet here i am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because its easier to do than to work on anything particularly meaningful
i am grateful for the distraction
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
the boy walked down the street in a carefree way playing without notice of what was about him
he didnt hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road
he took a step toward it and in doing so sealed his fate
she sat in the darkened room waiting
it was now a standoff
he had the power to put her in the room but not the power to make her repent
it wasnt fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness she wouldnt change her attitude
at three years old sandys stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view
it was going to rain
the weather forecast didnt say that but the steel plate in his hip did
he had learned over the years to trust his hip over the weatherman
it was going to rain so he better get outside and prepare
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
you can decide what you want to do in life but i suggest doing something that creates
something that leaves a tangible thing once youre done
that way even after youre gone you will still live on in the things you created
was it enough that was the question he kept asking himself
was being satisfied enough he looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal
he knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasnt going to be enough
it was a question of which of the two she preferred
on the one hand the choice seemed simple
the more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most
it was the easy choice
the safe choice
but she wasnt sure she actually preferred it
she didnt understand how changed worked
when she looked at today compared to yesterday there was nothing that she could see that was different
yet when she looked at today compared to last year she couldnt see how anything was ever the same
the spot was perfect for camouflage
at least thats what she thought when she picked the spot
she couldnt imagine that anyone would ever be able to see her in these surroundings
so there she sat confident that she was hidden from the world and safe from danger
unfortunately she had not anticipated that others may be looking upon her from other angles and now they were stealthily descending toward her hiding spot
what is the best way to get what you want she asked
he looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldnt like his answer
he hesitated knowing that the truth would only hurt
how was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her
the red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox
it had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be the next as well
the other toys grumbled beneath
at one time each had held the spot of the red ball but over time they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
the chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years
the only difference was there was someone actually sitting in it
how long had it been since someone had done that ten years or more he imagined
yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now
im heading back to colorado tomorrow after being down in santa barbara over the weekend for the festival there
i will be making october plans once there and will try to arrange so im back here for the birthday if possible
ill let you know as soon as i know the doctors appointment schedule and my flight plans
he picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone
day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate
he couldnt be sure
day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion but he knew it was a long time
much too long
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
there are different types of secrets
she had held onto plenty of them during her life but this one was different
she found herself holding onto the worst type
it was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didnt tell someone about it but it could end up getting you killed if you did
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
dont be scared
the things out there that are unknown arent scary in themselves
they are just unknown at the moment
take the time to know them before you list them as scary
then the world will be a much less scary place for you

he heard the loud impact before he ever saw the result
it had been so loud that it had actually made him jump back in his seat
as soon as he recovered from the surprise he saw the crack in the windshield
it seemed to be an analogy of the current condition of his life
he couldnt move
his head throbbed and spun
he couldnt decide if it was the flu or the drinking last night
it was probably a combination of both

they argue
while the argument seems to be different the truth is its always the same
yes the topic may be different or the circumstances but when all said and done it all came back to the same thing
they both knew it but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue
so they continue to argue
the red glint of paint sparkled under the sun
he had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago
it was his baby and he spent hours caring for it pampering it and fondling over it
she knew this all too well and thats exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it
the box sat on the desk next to the computer
it had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier
she didnt who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been

many people say that life isnt like a bed of roses
i beg to differ
i think that life is quite like a bed of roses
just like life a bed of roses looks pretty on the outside but when youre in it you find that it is nothing but thorns and pain
i myself have been pricked quite badly
i inadvertently went to sees candy last week i was in the mall looking for phone repair and as it turns out sees candy now charges a dollar  a full dollar  for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings
i bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolatecaramelalmond things
the total cost was foursomething
i mean the candies were tasty and all but lets be real a snickers bar is fifty cents
after this dollarpercandy revelation i may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a sees candy any time soon

marylou wore the tiara with pride
there was something that made doing anything she didnt really want to do a bit easier when she wore it
she really didnt care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment
she asked the question even though she didnt really want to hear the answer
it was a nowin situation since she already knew
if he told the truth shed get confirmation of her worst fears
if he lied shed know that he wasnt who she thought he was which would be almost as bad
yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer
the wolves stopped in their tracks sizing up the mother and her cubs
it had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate
the cubs would make a good meal but there were high risks taking on the mother grizzly
a decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack
the shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember
in fact it was difficult for anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared
it had seemed theyd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place
why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time and again but while they all thought it nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it
so the shoes remained on the steps out of place in one sense but perfectly normal in another
sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things dont work out as planned
this had been his life for the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it
he didnt actually enjoy it but he had accepted it and come to terms with it
or at least he thought he had
all that changed when he put the key into the ignition turned it and the engine didnt make a sound
the alarm went off and jake rose awake
rising early had become a daily ritual one that he could not fully explain
from the outside it was a wonder that he was able to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely no plans to be productive during the entire day
spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure but this wasnt the type of excitement she was hoping to experience
as she contemplated the situation she found herself in she knew shed gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for
it wasnt often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal
i guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase meant to be
 that is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbojumbo
maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that meant to be is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all
but thats my existential underpants underpinnings showing
its the way the cookie crumbles

the day had begun on a bright note

not a literal one but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up
it was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it
she peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it
it wasnt
she opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers
shes asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore
the answers were always the same
well not exactly the same but the same in a general sense
a more accurate description was the answers never surprised her
so she asked for the 10000th time whats your favorite animal but this time was different
when she heard the young boys answer she wondered if she had heard him correctly
it seemed like it should have been so simple
there was nothing inherently difficult with getting the project done
it was simple and straightforward enough that even a child should have been able to complete it on time but that wasnt the case
the deadline had arrived and the project remained unfinished
the headphones were on
they had been utilized on purpose
she could hear her mom yelling in the background but couldnt make out exactly what the yelling was about
that was exactly why she had put them on
she knew her mom would enter her room at any minute and she could pretend that she hadnt heard any of the previous yelling
it was a scrape that he hardly noticed
sure there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures
there was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream
he felt perfectly normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him
there was something in the tree
it was difficult to tell from the ground but rachael could see movement
she squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement trying to decipher exactly what she had spied
the more she peered however the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination
nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree
then in the corner of her eye she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again
she tried not to judge him
his ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless
was he really the next einstein as she had been told on the off chance it was true she continued to try not to judge him
sometimes its simply better to ignore the haters
thats the lesson that toms dad had been trying to teach him but tom still couldnt let it go
he latched onto them and their hate and couldnt let it go but he also realized that this wasnt healthy
thats when he came up with his devious plan
dont forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price
when you purchase a child the latest smartphone youre also committing to a monthly phone bill
when you purchase the latest gaming system youre likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play
when you buy gifts its important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift itself
heres the thing
she doesnt have anything to prove but she is going to anyway
thats just her character
she knows she doesnt have to but she still will just to show you that she can
doubt her more and shell prove she can again
we all already know this and you will too
her mom had warned her
she had been warned time and again but she had refused to believe her
she had done everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion
so when the promotion was given to her main rival it not only stung it threw her belief system into disarray
it was her first big lesson in life but not the last
what was beyond the bend in the stream was unknown
both were curious but only one was brave enough to want to explore
that was the problem
there was always one that let fear rule her life
he had done everything right
there had been no mistakes throughout the entire process
it had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost
there was no time
he ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work but it didnt matter
he was late and if he didnt make this meeting on time someones life may be in danger
out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate
there is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house
i always fancy i see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least
he says that with my imaginative power and habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency
so i try
sometimes there isnt a good answer
no matter how you try to rationalize the outcome it doesnt make sense
and instead of an answer you are simply left with a question
why
he heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away
his heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint
it wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint
it was a weird concept
why would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button
to her surprise she found what she least expected to see
then came the night of the first falling star
it was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere
hundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star
it seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him
the cab arrived late
the inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months
the green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab
the correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice
the leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years
it wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it
the scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty
the jacket was in its prime and it knew it
waiting and watching
it was all she had done for the past weeks
when you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink that’s about all you can do anyway
she watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut
she couldn’t reach it if she wanted too with that hole in the floor
she thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down
eating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea
its a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing
raw fish is raw fish delicacy or not
pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field
cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side
what looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy
everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth
at that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider
i could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem
 he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent
it didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to
he watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence
there was no doubt that he was smart
the fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence
sitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by
he felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end
he closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled
he smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember
green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy
ants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore
at least this was the way it was supposed to be
something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway
it was easy to spot her
all you needed to do was look at her socks
they were never a matching pair
one would be green while the other would be blue
one would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle
every other part of her was perfect but never the socks
they were her micro act of rebellion
she looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen
she tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry
it hit her all at once
she was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time
she counted
one
she could hear the steps coming closer
two
puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth
three
he stopped beside her
four
she pulled the trigger of the gun
the robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid
sir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card
i glared as i pushed the glass across the table
he ordered his regular breakfast
two eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon
he continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new
this was also part of the routine
a few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all
it was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years
he was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate
he knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time
it had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it
nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement
a long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead
they were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola
explain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked
all the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so
i should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me
