make sense\\nand instead of an answer you are simply left with a question\\nwhy\\nhe heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away\\nhis heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint\\nit wasnt a gunshot it wasnt a gunshot he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint\\nit was a weird concept\\nwhy would i really need to generate a random paragraph could i actually learn something from doing so all these questions were running through her head as she pressed the generate button\\nto her surprise she found what she least expected to see\\nthen came the night of the first falling star\\nit was seen early in the morning rushing over winchester eastward a line of flame high in the atmosphere\\nhundreds must have seen it and taken it for an ordinary falling star\\nit seemed that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of him\\nthe cab arrived late\\nthe inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning and it didnt appear that it had been cleaned in months\\nthe green tree airfreshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab\\nthe correct decision in this case was to get the hell out of it and to call another cab but she was late and didnt have a choice\\nthe leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years\\nit wore those scars with pride feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it\\nthe scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty\\nthe jacket was in its prime and it knew it\\nwaiting and watching\\nit was all she had done for the past weeks\\nwhen you’re locked in a room with nothing but food and drink that’s about all you can do anyway\\nshe watched as birds flew past the window bolted shut\\nshe couldn’t reach it if she wanted too with that hole in the floor\\nshe thought she could escape through it but three stories is a bit far down\\neating raw fish didnt sound like a good idea\\nits a delicacy in japan didnt seem to make it any more appetizing\\nraw fish is raw fish delicacy or not\\npink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field\\ncotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side\\nwhat looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy\\neverything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth\\nat that moment he had a thought that hed never imagine hed consider\\ni could just cheat he thought and that would solve the problem\\n he tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent\\nit didnt want to go away and if he was honest with himself he didnt want it to\\nhe watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence\\nthere was no doubt that he was smart\\nthe fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence\\nsitting in the sun away from everyone who had done him harm in the past he quietly listened to those who roamed by\\nhe felt at peace in the moment hoping it would last but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end\\nhe closed his eyes the sun beating down on face and he smiled\\nhe smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember\\ngreen vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy\\nants used the vine as their private highway avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore\\nat least this was the way it was supposed to be\\nsomething had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway\\nit was easy to spot her\\nall you needed to do was look at her socks\\nthey were never a matching pair\\none would be green while the other would be blue\\none would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle\\nevery other part of her was perfect but never the socks\\nthey were her micro act of rebellion\\nshe looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen\\nshe tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry\\nit hit her all at once\\nshe was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear sadness and pride all running through her at the same time\\nshe counted\\none\\nshe could hear the steps coming closer\\ntwo\\npuffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth\\nthree\\nhe stopped beside her\\nfour\\nshe pulled the trigger of the gun\\nthe robot clicked disapprovingly gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish liquid\\nsir you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkards grave dead of hepatic cirrhosis it informed me virtuously as it returned my id card\\ni glared as i pushed the glass across the table\\nhe ordered his regular breakfast\\ntwo eggs sunnyside up hash browns and two strips of bacon\\nhe continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new\\nthis was also part of the routine\\na few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all\\nit was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years\\nhe was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate\\nhe knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server icecream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time\\nit had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it\\nnobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement\\na long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five venusians very much startled looked overhead\\nthey were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information pepsicola\\nexplain to me again why i shouldnt cheat he asked\\nall the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so\\ni should go about being happy losing to cheaters because i know that i dont thats what youre telling me\\n'"
